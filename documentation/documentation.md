# Terraform Configuration for Proxmox Virtual Machines
This code is written in the Terraform language and is used to create a resource called "proxmox_vm_qemu" with the name "node".

## Count Variable
The "count" variable is set to 4, which means that four identical resources will be created with the same configuration.

## Target Node
The "target_node" variable is set to "proxmox", which specifies the target node or cluster where the virtual machines will be created.

## Virtual Machine Name
The "name" variable is set to "node-${count.index}", which creates a unique name for each virtual machine by appending the index of the count variable to the "node-" prefix.

## Description
The "desc" variable is set to "Vme" which would be used as a description for the virtual machine.

## Full Clone and Onboot
The "full_clone" variable is set to true, which means that the virtual machine will be a full clone of the original template. The "onboot" variable is set to true, which means that the virtual machine will be automatically started when the proxmox host is rebooted.

## Clone Template
The "clone" variable is set to "ubuntu-cloud", which specifies the name of the template that will be used as the base for the virtual machines.

## Virtual Machine Configuration
"cores" and "sockets" variables are set to 1, which specifies that each virtual machine will have 1 core and 1 socket.
"cpu" variable is set to "host", which means that the virtual machine will use the same CPU type as the proxmox host.
"memory" variable is set to 1024, which specifies that each virtual machine will have 1GB of memory.
"disk" block of code configures the virtual machine's hard drive with type "scsi", storage "local-lvm" and size "16G".
"network" block of code configures the virtual machine's network with bridge "vmbr0" and model "virtio".
Operating System
The "os_type" variable is set to "cloud-init" which is an open-source tool used to customize virtual machines when they are first started.

## IP Configuration
The "ipconfig0" variable is set to "ip=192.168.1.${100 + count.index}/24,gw=192.168.1.254", which creates a unique IP address for each virtual machine by appending the index of the count variable to the IP address prefix. The "nameserver" variable is set to "192.168.1.254", which specifies the IP address of the name server that the virtual machine will use.

This code is creating 4 virtual machines with the same configuration on a proxmox cluster. Each virtual machine will be a clone of the "ubuntu-cloud" template, with 1 core, 1 socket, 1GB of memory and a 16GB hard drive, a unique IP address and use the same CPU type as the host. The virtual machines will be automatically started when the proxmox host is rebooted.
